        "# Large Language Model Usage in Digital Discourse\n",
        "\n",
        "As of December 2025 (things change fast!): Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a practical methodological tool in Digital Discourse Analysis, not as replacements for theory-driven interpretation, but as instruments that scale and accelerate interpretive labor.\n",
        "\n",
        "Their primary value lies in handling discourse-level phenomena—such as framing, stance, argumentation, and narrative roles—that are difficult to capture with traditional rule-based or statistical NLP methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "When used critically and transparently, LLMs enable researchers to annotate large corpora, explore patterns across time and languages, and support comparative analysis that would otherwise be infeasible. At the same time, LLM outputs remain probabilistic, interpretive, and error-prone, making methodological control, validation, and human oversight essential. Properly positioned, LLMs function as advanced analytical assistants within established Digital Discourse frameworks rather than as autonomous authorities on meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Discourse-Level Annotation at Scale\n",
        "\n",
        "- Automatic labeling of discourse features that are contextual and interpretive rather than purely lexical  \n",
        "- Typical annotation tasks:\n",
        "  - Stance detection (support / oppose / neutral)\n",
        "  - Framing detection (economic, moral, security, cultural, etc.)\n",
        "  - Actor roles (government, citizen, expert, institution, scapegoat)\n",
        "  - Narrative positions (victim, threat, hero, authority)\n",
        "  - Politeness, aggression, irony, sarcasm\n",
        "  - Modality and certainty (hedging, obligation, inevitability)\n",
        "- Strengths:\n",
        "  - Handles multi-sentence context\n",
        "  - Performs better than keyword or rule-based systems on indirect language\n",
        "- Methodological notes:\n",
        "  - Use closed and well-defined label sets\n",
        "  - Validate on a human-annotated subset\n",
