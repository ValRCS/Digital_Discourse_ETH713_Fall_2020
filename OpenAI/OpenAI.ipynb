        "* Google did most of the original reasearch on Large Language Models in the last 15 years - but has not capitalized on it\n",
        "* Instead companies such as OpenAI have overtaken Google in the mind-share and usability\n",
        "* It is a classical case of Innovators Dilemma - Google was making too much money on their Search and they were afraid to hurt their product, now they have little choice\n",
        "(lots of analogies elsewhere, for example BMW early electrical car looked very different from standard BMW because they were afraid of hurting their main product, now BMW realized that they have to catch up to companies such as Tesle, etc)\n",
        "\n",
        "OpenAI is not immune, there are companies, startups such as Mistral from France, Europe that are very promising and may overtake OpenAI.\n",
        "Competition in this field is high - and OpenAI could use some competition, because OpenAI is not actually open...\n",
        "\n",
        "So pragmatically for now we will be using OpenAI to do our LLM tasks."
